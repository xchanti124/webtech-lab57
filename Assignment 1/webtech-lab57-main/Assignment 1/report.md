Browser compatibility testing

For testing purposes, we rendered the HTML and CSS code in multiple browsers so that we could see if there were any inconsistencies.
Due to some browsers having inconsistent padding and margins of the elements, we initialized the padding and margins to 0 in the CSS files
so that there would be no inconsistent behavior.

-   Chromium based browsers
    -   All of the HTML and CSS renders well on chromium-based browsers.
    -   Everything rendered fine
-   Firefox
    -   No unexpected issues.
-   Safari
    -   No unexpected issues.

For accessibility on smaller devices we used media queries and created a design for tablets and smartphones which will make
the website enjoyable to use.

The print layout was improved by using pagebreak so that one element would be printed per page to avoid messy pages.
